** Made by: Darsh Patel**

## Abstract


StockSmart_iOS is a iOS application designed to provide users with the latest updates on the stock market, making it easy to stay informed about company news and data comparisons through responsive and user-friendly graphs. Connected to a MongoDB database, StockSmart allows users to store information and conduct mock trading, providing precise profit or loss values. The app automatically updates every 15 seconds to ensure users have the most current information. It also displays peer performance for companies, simplifying the trading process. The application is fully responsive and easy to use. Using the Finnhub API, I have integrated real-time data retrieval via Node.js/Express.js and developed a custom RESTful API for the frontend to deliver fast and efficient results. The MongoDB database supports mock trading by facilitating buy/sell transactions.
